Run bootstrap.sh to install some dependencies:

* Bazel
* Qt4
* OpenSceneGraph (locally built)

and get some data, which includes KITTI data in the needed directory structure,
and other parameters and visualization tools.

After running bootstrap.sh, go to the cc directory, which is a bazel project. To
build everything:

$ bazel build //..

After building, you can run with a command like:

$ ./bazel-bin/app/flow/viewer

This assumes that the data was put in $HOME/data/tsf_data. Otherwise:

$ ./bazel-bin/app/flow/viewer --tsf_data_dir path/to/tsf_data
